BUILDING ON LINUX
=================
For building on Debian/Ubuntu, you need to install the following packages:
  aptitude install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libvorbis-dev libtool

For audio output you need to pick one of the below packages to install
  # Audio with GStreamer backend (default)
  aptitude install libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0 libgstreamer0.10-dev

  # Audio with libao backend
  aptitude install libao-dev

  # Audio with PulseAudio backend (has a known issue with playing next song)
  aptitude install libpulse-dev

Which audio back is selected is controlled via the file src/Makefile.local.mk.
That file is created from src/Makefile.local.mk.dist when make is run.
Uncomment the audio backend you would like to use in Makefile.local.mk:
  ## Choose audio backend
  LINUX_BACKEND = gstreamer
  # LINUX_BACKEND = pulseaudio
  # LINUX_BACKEND = libao


BUILDING ON MACOSX
==================
The following extra packages are required to build despotify on Mac OS X
  ncurses openssl zlib libvorbis expat

They can be installed from MacPorts or manually.
