Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On OS X, using pkgconfig from ports, you might get this error:
(But only if you've changed the bindings)

 Package despotify was not found in the pkg-config search path.
 Perhaps you should add the directory containing `despotify.pc'
 to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
 No package 'despotify' found

Then a bunch of GCC errors saying "No such file or directory".

This happens because despotify doesn't install it's pkgconfig file
to the same location as ports installs its stuff to. It's easily fixed
by running this before build:

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig

Thanks to Simo Salminen for reporting this.

If you have other problems that you can't figure out, ask in 
our channel, #despotify on EFNet, or send me an email!
