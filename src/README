Distribution information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The distribution is organized as follows:

 . 
 |- lib      -- libdespotify lives here, and everything else either
 |              depends on it or will eventually depend on it.
 |- bindings -- language bindings are found here, e.g. python bindings
 |              to libdespotify. they need to be built individually, and
 |              not using the top level makefile. see bindings/README
 |              for more information.
 \- clients  -- here you can find the various stock clients, each in
                it's own subdir. most of them are built by the top level
                makefile, at least those that need to be built. see
                clients/README for more information about the clients.

See http://despotify.se/ for more information.
