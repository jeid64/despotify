  1. Checksum calculation of playlist tracks doesn't add upp when "they are large and had a bunch of changes".
     This makes TestLoadUserPlaylists fail if your account contains any such playlists. 

  2. Remove playlist form user does not seem to work. TestAddTracksToPlaylist should fail here, but it doesn't!
