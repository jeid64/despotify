Despotify - the open source Spotify client
http://despotify.se/


Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~
Despotify can only be utilized with "Premium" Spotify accounts. 

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~
The latest version of the source code can be checked out from our Subversion repository
  $ svn checkout https://despotify.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/despotify despotify


Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~
The checked out source code contains a number of directories
  java/		This is where one of the available Java implementations go
  src/		This is where the C based client, library and Python bindings go
  web/		This is where the source code for our web site goes (http://despotify.se)


Build instructions for the simple client and library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need a few libraries to be able to build despotify
If you're running Debian/Ubuntu they can be installed with the following commands
  # aptitude install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libvorbis-dev libtool
  # aptitude install libpulse-dev # For pulseaudio backend
  # aptitude install libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-0 libgstreamer0.10-dev # For GStreamer backend
  # aptitude install libao-dev # For libao backend

If you encounter any problems, ask a friend or ask in the channel
#despotify on EFNet (example EFNet servers: irc.swepipe.se, efnet.xs4all.nl)


1. Goto the directory src/ where the despotify library and client is located
   $ cd src

2. Optionial (..because just running make will do this for you otherwise)
 - 2.1 Copy Makefile.local.mk.dist to Makefile.local.mk
       $ cp Makefile.local.mk.dist Makefile.local.mk

 - 2.2 Make local adjustments such as specifying additional path for where 
       the compiler's linker should look for libraries (modify LDFLAGS)
       or install to a different prefix (i.e. /usr/local instead of /usr)
       $ nano Makefile.local.mk

3. Run make
   $ make

4. Install
   $ sudo make install

5. You'll now have a client called 'despotify-simple' and a gateway called 'gateway'
   installed under ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin (usually this will be /usr/bin)
